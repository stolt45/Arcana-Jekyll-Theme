                <p>Sharon has been designing and delivering results-oriented development programs since 2002. 
                Part educator, part motivational speaker, Sharon designs and delivers learning experiences that teach new 
                knowledge and skills and inspire the behavior change needed for success.</p>
                            
                <!--<h3>And Yet Another Subheading</h3>-->
                <p>The first training session Sharon led was prompted by her goal to reduce Aramark Educational Services’ 
                (AER’s) $2M in potential missed Work Opportunity Tax Credit. She negotiated 15 minutes on the agenda at the 
                company’s new manager orientation; her talk was the only thing standing between the managers and their flight 
                home after a long week of training. Walking into the room, she threw thousands of play dollars into the air 
                and proceeded to give a compelling presentation on how each manager could recoup the WOTC to his or her bottom 
                line. Over the next 12 months, AER’s potential missed tax credit dropped to less than $1M, and Sharon earned 
                her reputation for bringing an unexpected twist to otherwise dry training topics.</p>

                <p>Before she founded Stolt Consulting in 2016, Sharon was Director of Learning & Development at Visa, Inc., 
                where she developed and launched the company’s first comprehensive manager training program, The Visa Manager 
                Experience. In 2013, Sharon was awarded Visa’s highest honor, the annual Go Beyond Award, as a result of her 
                work on the program. From 2015-2016, Sharon led the design and launch of the inaugural Visa University campus 
                in Foster City, CA.</p>

                <p>Sharon is passionate about causes that benefit her local community and increase educational and development 
                opportunities for historically underrepresented groups. She volunteers weekly in a special education classroom 
                at King Child Development Center through the Berkeley Schools Fund.</p>

                <p>Sharon lives in Berkeley with her husband, Chris, their dog, Bailey, and their extensive collection of  
                California wines. Sharon enjoys experimenting with new recipes and exploring hiking trails, and has been 
                conducting rigorous taste-testing for the best cupcake in the Bay Area for nearly 7 years.</p>
